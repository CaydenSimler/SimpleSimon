Simple Simon Game Plans

Rules:

	Color Sequence Game, progressively getting harder as rounds go on
	You must enter the color sequence in CORRECT order each time
		if you do, then one more color is added onto the sequence
		if you don't, then game over
	Color sequence should be RANDOM each round

Pseudo-Code:

	globals:
		var colorOrder = "",
			inputOrder = "",
			roundNumber = "",
			red = 1,
			yellow = 2,
			blue = 3,
			green = 4;

	colors should be represented by a number in order to better track sequence/order
		everytime a new number is generated, it is appended onto the colorOrder string

	buttons should be wired up to each color and then output the number represented by the color
		example: if red is pressed, 1 is appended onto the inputOrder string

	after each round, the colorOrder string should be compared to the inputOrder string
		if they match, another color is added onto the colorOrder string
		if they don't match, game over, colorOrder and inputOrder is reset back to an empty string

	Functions:
		- startGame function that is wired to a click event listener button that generates the first randomColor and appends it to the colorOrder string
		- Create random color order each time by using Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1
		- randomColor is appended onto the colorOrder string each round
		- after each round, colorOrder is compared to inputOrder
			if/else statement needed for comparison
			example:
				if (colorOrder == inputOrder) {
					append next new randomColor to colorOrder string
				} else {
					reset game using the gameOver function (this shouldrun the gameReset function)
				}
		- function that changes the css class of each color, one by one, starting at the beginning of the colorOrder string with an appropriate amount of time between each css display class activated
		- gameRound function that increases the number of rounds by one after each round
		- gameOver function that resets the game, and the colorOrder/inputOrder strings
			this should run a gameReset function that sets everything back to the start and empties out all the strings
				gameReset function should also display a message/alert/animation that displays that inputOrder !== colorOrder

	Event Listeners: 
		- one click event listener needed for each color (red, yellow, blue, green)
		- a click event listener needed to start the game and run the startGame function
	
Extra Features:
	
	- limit the time allowed between choosing the next correct color in the sequence
		easy = unlimited time to choose the next correct color in the sequence
		medium = 10 seconds to choose the next correct color in the sequence
		hard = 3 seconds to choose the next correct color in the sequence
		kappa = 1 second to choose the next correct color in the sequence
	- change the order of the colors after a specific amount of rounds
		easy = never change the order of the colors
		medium = change the order of the colors every 10 rounds
		hard = change the order of the colors every 5 rounds
		kappa = change the order of the colors every round
	- different color schemes (for difficulty or just for looks)
		for difficulty levels:
			default = red, yellow, blue, green
			hard = red, orange, yellow, pink
			kappa = grayscale
		for looks:
			color blindness = hues of color easier to suit color blindness
			bluescale = different shades of blue
			redscale = different shades of red
